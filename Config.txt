obviously, because I can write, I will try to describe everything in as much detail as I can if you do want to edit this file for some reason.


GENERAL SETTINGS

The location that the program stores all your custom songs to.
<Custom Song List Location|Custom_Song_List.txt|> 

The currently selected profile. The program reads and (will eventually) make the second part be on the dropdown by default
<Selected Profile|PC|>

The volume that the volume slider starts at
<Volume|29|>


PROFILES

Profiles follow the following format:
Profile being the Setting option
The first entry after that is the profile name
The entry after that is the file location for that profile
<Profile|PC|C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Metal Hellsinger/Metal_Data/StreamingAssets/customsongs.json|>
<Profile|VR|C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/MetalHellsingerVR/MetalVR_Data/StreamingAssets/customsongs.json|>
<Profile|TEST|Test.json|>
